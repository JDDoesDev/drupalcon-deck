    Spreading ignorance is my true nightmare. There’s a subtle (yet incredibly important) difference between trying and failing at something vs asserting a complete falsehood as truth. Not only do you look foolish, but you make life harder for people who truly know the subject you’ve failed to understand properly. These people now have to spend their time fixing the mess you’ve created.
